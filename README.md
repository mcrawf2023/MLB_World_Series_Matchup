For this project, I used R to analyze the potential matchup for the 2023 MLB World Series. I began this project when the Rangers had already won the ALCS, but the Phillies were leading the NLCS 3-2 so I mistakenly anticipated that they would win and used them in my analysis. First, I compared the head-to-head pitching matchup between Zack Wheeler and Nathan Eovaldi by analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, and speed of their pitches. I proceeded to analyze a potential matchup between Nathan Eovaldi as the pitcher and Bryce Harper as the batter. I concluded that the matchup slightly favored Eovaldi because his strongest pitch in terms of its positive impact on his win probability and negative impact on opponent batting average while it is one of Harper's weakest pitches. However, Eovaldiâ€™s fallback pitch, the curveball, is one of the pitches Bryce Harper hits the strongest. Especially if Eovaldi falls behind in the count and must rely on his curveball, the matchup would favor Harper.
