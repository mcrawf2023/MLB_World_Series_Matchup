For this project, I used R to analyze the potential matchup for the 2023 MLB World Series. I began this project when the Rangers had already won the ALCS, but the Phillies were leading the NLCS 3-2 so I mistakenly anticipated that they would win and used them in my analysis. First, I compared the head-to-head pitching matchup between Zack Wheeler and Nathan Eovaldi by analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, and speed of their pitches. I proceeded to analyze a potential matchup between Nathan Eovaldi as the pitcher and Bryce Harper as the batter.
